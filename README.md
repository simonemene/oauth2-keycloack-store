# OAUTH2/OPENID KEYCLOAK STORE

A demo project showcasing integration of Spring Security with **Keycloak** for stateless authentication using OAuth2 and OpenID Connect. This is a simple online store where users can register, authenticate, and purchase articles.

## Features

- Centralized authentication via Keycloak  
- OAuth2/OpenID Connect for identity and session management  
- Password hashing and user management delegated to Keycloak  
- Role-based access control managed through Keycloak roles  
- Stateless session management without JSESSIONID (tokens handled by Keycloak)  
- User roles and accounts configured inside Keycloak  

| Role  | Description                   | Email             | Password |
|-------|-------------------------------|-------------------|----------|
| USER  | Regular users (self-register)  | -                 | -        |
| ADMIN | Administrator                | admin@example.it  | admin    |
| TRACK | Order tracking operator       | track@example.it  | track    |

## Overview

This project demonstrates a modern authentication flow using **Keycloak**:

- Users authenticate via Keycloakâ€™s OAuth2/OpenID Connect server  
- Upon successful login, Keycloak issues tokens (access and ID tokens)  
- Subsequent requests to the backend include the access token in the Authorization header  
- The backend validates the token with Keycloak and applies role-based access control  
- This approach removes the need for traditional session tracking (e.g., JSESSIONID), improving scalability with stateless authentication  

## Security Notice

- Credentials are sent only once during authentication via Keycloak  
- Always use HTTPS in production  
- Store tokens securely (e.g., in memory, or HttpOnly cookies if applicable)  
- Consider token expiration and refresh policies configured in Keycloak for added security  

> **Note:** This is a demo project and not production-ready. For production use, ensure secure token handling, refresh token usage, and proper Keycloak server hardening.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+  
- Maven  
- A configured relational database (e.g., MySQL or H2)  
- Node.js & npm (for the frontend)  
- A running Keycloak server configured with realms, clients, and roles  

### Running the Application

#### Option 1: Manual Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/simonemene/oauth2-keycloak-store.git
cd oauth2-keycloak-store

# Run the Spring Boot backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
# or, if Maven is installed globally
mvn spring-boot:run

# Run the Angular frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
Make sure to configure the backend and frontend to connect to your Keycloak server.

Option 2: Docker Compose
bash
Copia
Modifica
# Build the backend JAR file
cd backend
./mvnw clean package

# Build the frontend production bundle
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run build

# Start the application stack with Docker Compose
docker compose up --build
This will build and start the backend, MySQL database, frontend containers. Ensure Keycloak is running and properly configured.
